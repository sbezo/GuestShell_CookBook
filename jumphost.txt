# Allows ssh tunneling via jumphost. Tested for ssh and http protocols

# It is usefull when you have direct access only to switch. Switch can be used as a jumphost to another servers.
# It could also solve issue with remote server without GW. (another NIC of Guestshell can be used) 

# create users for ssh tunneling
sudo useradd -m transfer
sudo passwd transfer

# tunnel ssh/http via jumphost (guestshell) 
# 10.10.64.10 is guestshell IP -jumphost
# 'transfer' is user on guestshell
# 10.10.20.161 is remote SSH/HTTP server(listens on port 22/80)
ssh -N transfer@10.10.64.10 -L 2222:10.10.20.161:22
ssh -N transfer@10.10.64.10 -L 8080:10.10.20.161:80
ssh -N transfer@10.10.64.10 -L 2222:10.10.65.1:22

# '2222' is local port on laptop used for SSH via Jumphost
# '8080' is local port on laptop used for HTTP via Jumphost

# access remote SSH/HTTP from laptop
ssh ubuntu@localhost -p 2222
# open browser 'localhost:8080'
