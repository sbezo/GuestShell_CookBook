Guestshell is a virtualized Linux-based environment, designed to run custom Linux applications, including Python for automated control and management of Cisco devices. 
It also includes the automated provisioning (Day zero) of systems. This container shell provides a secure environment, decoupled from the host device, in which users can install scripts or software packages and run them.
